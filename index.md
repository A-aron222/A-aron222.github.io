I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favortie CPSC 120l Labs

* Lab 3, Part 1:

    This lab was my favorite because it allowed me to fully understand how to program a mathematical algorithm. I really liked the simplicity of user input was. All users had to do was answer quick and necessary details and the computer would print out the calculated BMR back to the user, specifying the calories for man or woman based on height, weight, and age. Learning user inputs and computated outputs using mathematical algorithm was challenging, but the feeling of a successful outcome was rewarding.

* Lab 7, Part 1:

    I enjoyed doing this lab with my partner because this one helped us understand the restrictions and certain paramaters a program might need for it to function logically. It was great that this program had an algorithm that applied to a real-world scenario - parking rules. At first, we could not grasp the concept of properly using if/else statements for timing on a street, but as we kept working on it, we got the hang of it. The best part was that it allowed us to understand that these if/else statements are necessary for real-world use, and I look forward to creating more projects in the future that requires logic and programs that require carefully thought out limits and boundaries.

* Lab 9, Part 2:

    Although this lab might have been the most challenging in my opinion, I had a good time creating a game where it would require not one, but two programs for the overall game to function properly. I learned that creating a .dat file is quite useful as it has the value stored in it as an input from that file to the other file where the actual program is run. For example, in this game, we programmed a file called secret.dat that stores the secret number inputted from player 1. The second file (game.cc), has the player 2 guess which number player 1. This kind of program is necessary because player 2 would never see the secret number that player 1 put down, which made it a fun program to experience.
